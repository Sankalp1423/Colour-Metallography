# Colour-Metallography
This project focuses on color metallography to reveal microstructures in metal samples. Kalling’s and Beraha’s reagents were used for etching, with 10x and 50x magnification to highlight phases and grains.

Method:
In this project, color metallography was performed using two different etchants:

Kalling’s Reagent:
This etchant is frequently used to bring out phases in steel and other alloys.
The microstructures were observed under two magnifications:
10x objective
50x objective

Beraha’s Reagent
This coloring etchant is used to produce a range of colors due to interference effects.
The specimen was etched for 21 seconds.
The microstructure was then viewed under 50x objective magnification.

Procedure:
The metal samples were first ground, polished, and cleaned to produce a smooth, mirror-like surface.
The samples were then etched with Kalling’s reagent and Beraha’s reagent for the specified periods.
After etching, the samples were washed, dried, and examined under an optical microscope.

Microstructural Analysis:
The color contrast produced by these etchants helps to identify different phases, grains, and structural features within the metal.
The 10x and 50x magnification allows for both an overview and a more detailed view of the microstructures.
